## Implementation

For this project, we decided to implement our decentralized application (DApp) on top of a privately run Neo Blockchain, mainly because it promised useful functionality such as Smart Contract development in a variety of high-level programming languages, promised developer support from the Neo Foundation and the assumed popularity as it claims around 100 DApps built on top of its platform. <br>

During actual development, in which we agreed to code in the programming language Python for easier syntactic understanding within our group, we realized that although the provided compiler supports smart contract development in Python, the documentation is very limited. The Foundation pointed us to projects maintained by the open-source community such as NEON and NEO-boa. Unfortunately, those projects do not have a documentation of the full functionality, such that we were unable to look up necessary methods and wrap our minds around the structure of the code the compiler expects. This was amplified by the fact that the claim of around 100 DApps is misleading, as many of them are not open-source, and most of the ones that are were developed in another programming language than Python. Hence, we were stuck, and the developer support was fairly limited in its support in this case.<br>

We switched to the TypeScript programming language, which no member of our group has used before, which is similar to JavaScript, but maintained by Microsoft, as the online neo-one project was the single most useful resource to learn Neo DApp backend development we could find. This proved to be a good step, as the project also comes with a webapp to compile the code and find any errors. <br>

The Neo Platform itself proves interesting, as the dual-token system of NEO and GAS increases complexity for our project. GAS is used for smart contract deployment and interaction and NEO as a utility token within the network. As we were running our own private network for the blockchain, we were able to engineer our own coin without having to worry about the NEO distinction. A benefit of the Neo platform is the documentation and active open-source discussion about new developments and improvements of the platform. Neo is always evolving and has some exciting new features coming with its newest version, Neo3. However, we were not able to exploit these in this project yet.<br>

In the end, although Neo is a well-maintained project with lots of business resources, Neo relies heavily on open-source development, which is proved complicated to set up, with few full example projects for specific languages provided and a distributed documentation which proved less helpful than expected for the variety of features promoted by the Foundation.
