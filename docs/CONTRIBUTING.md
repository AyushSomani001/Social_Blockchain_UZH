## **Technical Problem Faced:** <br>
- Scars Documentation about the smart contracts in Python and C#.
- Fallback to JS after Evaluation of Python-Boa and Neon which has consumed lot of our initial time.

## **Work Done:** <br>
- Writing and Building Smart Contract in TypeScript with NEO Playground.
- Tried Smart Contract in Python and C#. Deployment and Invoking of Smart Contract with Neo Compiler.
- Understanding the technical part of NEO-ANS, Wallet and NEP-5 Contract.
- Evaluated Ripple to check if it fits our use-case better. Eventually rejected it because it was built to fiat currency in mind rather than a custom token.
- Created a Back-up plan with Frederick on Ethereum based Solution.
- Team Discussion for finalization of token categorization and features of the BlockChain.
