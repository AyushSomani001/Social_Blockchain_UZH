Problem Faced:
- Scarce Documentation about Neo smart contracts in Python and C#.
- Fallback to TypeScript after Evaluation of Python-Boa and neo-python which has consumed lot of our initial time.

Work Done:
- Writing and Building Smart Contracts in TypeScript with NEO Playground.
- Tried Smart Contract in Python and C#. Deployment and Invoking of Smart Contract with Neo Compiler.
- Set up of local Neo test network
- Understanding the technical part of NEO-ANS, Wallet and NEP-5 Contract.
- Evaluated Ripple to check if it fits our use-case better. Eventually rejected it because it was built to fiat currency in mind rather than a non-convertible token.
- Created a back-up plan with on Ethereum based Solution.
- Team Discussion for finalization of token categorization and features of the BlockChain.
