<b> Developing an Incentivised Social Media Platform with NEO Dapp using TypeScript</b> <br>
A social platform to incentivize more people contribute to society by introducing a tokenized economy of benefits.  <br>
- This is an example of a Social Token, an Incentivized Social Activity Token <br>
- The Token is non-fungible (ERC721)<br>
- The Basic structure of our token is retrieved from ....
- The process is as follows: The Goverment issues Token based on an allocated Fund -> Government distributes tokens among needy individuals and organizations promoting and offering opportunities for volunteering. The contributors get rewarded for participating in volunteering activities by earning some amount of tokens -> The tokens can be later used at any public facility participating in the project like public transportation (e.g. buses, metro, bike/scooter sharing).
- At the end the token is returned to the Government and the contract is set to inactive in the system.
- We aim to create the token on the NEO ONE platform and develop a smart contract for bike sharing as an example of application.
